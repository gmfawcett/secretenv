This is my first package ever. Notes of my journey are here:

- https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/

In particular,

#+begin_src bash
python3 -m build
python -m twine upload dist/*
#+end_src

- made a ~venv~ and installed build and twine into that. Using the nixpkgs
  versions led to errors in the build, not sure why.

- try to convert setup.py to setup.cfg.
